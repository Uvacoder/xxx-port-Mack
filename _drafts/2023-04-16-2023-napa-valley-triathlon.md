#### Discussion

Notes:
- This was David's first official triathlon!
- Popped a tire the night before
- Water was very cold, shortened
- Didn't train as much for the swim
- Felt very dizzy during T1
- The bike and run were very hilly
- I left the bike rack on - oh, well
- Ate a croissant on the bike
- Nutrition was much better this time around
