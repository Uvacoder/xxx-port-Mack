Last November, Christine and I bought our first car together: a Honda CR-V.
We drove it all across the county, racking up more than 15,000 miles in less
than twelve months. Today we took it - it still doesn't have a name - in for an
oil change. We spent a few minutes debating whether to take it to the Honda
dealership or an independent shop, but settled on the dealership for peace of
mind, even if it meant paying a bit more.

To our surprise, and eventual delight, the mechanic showed us that the vehicle
*knows what maintenance it needs*. With little fanfare, he translated our code
as, "Oil change, tire rotation, and rear differential fluid replacement." There
was no back-and-forth, no concern that we were paying for more than necessary.
Two short hours and a few hundred dollars later, we're good for another 5,000
miles.

Which makes me wonder: how were codes not always a thing? Alternatively, how did
I not know about them today? They make the maintenance so much simpler - I don't
have to trust the mechanic, just the car that *I already implicitly trust* by
driving it almost every day. Kudos to Honda, and to Tim from Honda for teaching
us about the codes.
