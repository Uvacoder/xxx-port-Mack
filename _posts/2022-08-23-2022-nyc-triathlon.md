#### Discussion

Last month, I completed my third ever triathlon. It was originally supposed to be
olympic distance but the bike and run portions were shortened due to a heat
advistory (97Â° F). I was initially quite disappointed, especially given the cost
of the event ($400), but I decided to just make the best of the situation,
rather than try to defer until next year.

After a 40-minute delay due to issues with the swim exit, the race began with a
dip in the Hudson River. I'll be honest, it was gross. The water was warm,
murky, and tasted like rotten laundry. It was also crowded; I accidentally
dunked someone towards the beginning of the race. Sorry to whoever that was.

As always, I went out way too fast and never settled into a comfortable pace; my
heart rate was ~170 bpm for roughly the entire swim - much higher than my usual
~140 bpm. At one point I swam too close to the shore and scratched my foot on a
rock, which prompted a post-race tetanus shot. Fun stuff.

Anyways, once I was out of the water, the shortened bike and run portions of the
race were a blur. It was nice to ride on car-free highways, though the roads
themselves could use some work (read: bumpy). The run was nice and the park was
scenic. The cold towel at the finish line was much appreciated.

All-in-all, I'm happy I did the race, though it's one I'll probably never do again.
I'm also satisfied with my performance, especially the fact that I beat my rival
from the last race. I love some friendly competition! Onwards to Lake George!

Lessons learned:

- Bring shoes for the walk from the transition area to the swim start
- It was definitely too hot for wetsuits, and I'm happy I spared
mine the Hudson
- I was dizzy out of the swim again, need to take my time exiting the water
- I got lost in the transition area, need to practice transitions next time
- I forgot to stand on my transition mat again, defeating its entire purpose (lol)
- I decided not to use my new goggles - thank god, because they had a leak
