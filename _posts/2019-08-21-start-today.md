Often times I'll think to myself, "If only I had started yesterday." Started
that project, that blog post, that book. Started investing. Started learning a
new language. Started working out. Started traveling. Started journaling. The
list goes on.

When that happens, it's helpful to remember: everyone starts somewhere. Every
single person that I look up to today was once where I am - at the starting
line. It's just that they made the decision to begin a little bit sooner.

Time passes more quickly than you think, and the world ain't getting any
smaller. If you start today - whatever it is - I can almost guarantee that not
too far from now, people will look at you and think, "If only I had started
yesterday."

(I've already experienced this phenomenon with, e.g., open source projects. When
I first started working on them, it didn't feel like they were actually going to
go anywhere. Sure enough, years later, they're starting to pick up some steam.
It's really nice when an investment pays off.)
