#### Discussion

First, yes, this report is long overdue, but hey, late is better than never.
Also, I'm not quite sure how to structure this report because there's so much I
want to say about this race. Bear with me...

##### The Course

I haven't completed *that* many long races - grain of salt - but this was my
favorite so far.

The water: clear, cool, and tasted as if straight out of the bottle. Lake
water is *so* much better than the Long Island Sound, where I trained, in terms
of taste, visibility, and waves (or lack thereof).

The bike course was a beautiful - calm? - trip around Brant Lake, one of Lake
George's smaller cousins. The roads were smooth, the air was crisp, and the
traffic was light. There were a few rolling hills and I made sure to take every
downhill as an opportunity to practice my roller-coaster whoops. (Ok, not
*every* downhill, but definitely more than one.) The last few miles back into
town were a little tricky - one of my fellow racers almost hit an old woman
crossing the street - but other than that, all good.

The run was meh. Two out-and-backs, uphill in the "out" direction, some of
it along a relatively busy road. By the second lap, the sun was out in full
force and I wished there was a tad more shade. Still, the wooded areas were
pretty and the aid stations were well-stocked.

Oh, and the weather was *perfect*. Moderate temperatures, a few clouds in the
sky but no precipitation, and almost zero wind. Couldn't have asked for anything
better, though no guarantees for next year.

##### My Performance

My goals for this race - my first 70.3 - were as follows:
- Participate: have fun, don't get hurt
- Complete: finish the race
- Compete: finish under 6:30:00

My rough time estimates were:
- 0:45:00 swim
- 3:30:00 bike
- 2:00:00 run
- 0:15:00 T1 + T2

Somehow I achieved *all* of my goals - smashed them, actually, which means
I need to set harder goals next time. Regarding each segment:

**Swim**: Really proud of this swim. Stayed away from the chaos, swam in a straight line
(more or less), breathing was good, and pace was sub-2 (min / 100 yards).

**T1**: A bit of a jog to my bike but no big deal. Got my wetsuit off pretty
easily, dried my face, re-applied sunscreen, and off I went.

**Bike**: Overall, a great ride. The initial climb was cruel, but hey,
whatcha gonna do. Nutrition was good. Absolutely cooked my legs, though. Was
worried I didn’t save enough for the run but it turns out the muscle groups
don’t overlap that much (or at least that’s what it felt like).

**T2**: Took some time to reapply sunscreen and change into fresh socks, but
that’s about it.

**Run**: Brutal. Took a gel, couldn’t stomach any chews. The orange slices at
the aid stations came in clutch. Really wanted sub-2. ["Perservere
through the tough times,"](https://youtu.be/vT9LS2Z2RmI?t=886) carried
me to the finish line.


##### Lessons Learned

(Most of these were learned during training.)

- Wetsuits help prevent shock when you hit a cold pocket of water mid-swim
- Wearing gloves for bike rides doesn't just look cool - it helps prevent blisters
- Wearing a tri suit underneath a wetsuit is restrictive. Instead, it's much
  more comfortable to only weat the bottom half during the swim (if it's a
  one-piece, roll down the top half around your waist and stuff it underneath
  your wetsuit).
- Eating too much after big workout leads to bloating during the week
- Swimming in a wetsuit in warm water sucks
- Fresh socks at T2 are a game changer
- Triathlon is unique in that amateurs compete side-by-side with pros


##### Reflection

(I originally shared this post to Facebook, but I think it also belongs here.)

I love a good challenge. If it's daunting, even better. Progress makes me feel
alive, especially when it's hard-earned.

So a few years ago, when I [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG678spaEm0)
Matt Dajer from Yes Theory talk about completing a full-distance triathlon - an
Iron Man - I added it to my bucket list without hesitation. And there it sat,
patiently waiting for me to make it to base camp.

Since undergoing (relatively minor, thankfully) back surgery for a bad disk in
September of 2020, I've been slowly working my way there. At first just a few
steps, then a walk with the dog, then a stroll on the boardwalk, eventually a
jog. A new treadmill, some longer runs, my first half marathon post-surgery. A
failed attempt to run the San Francisco Marathon virtually, but success on the
second try - same story for the Brooklyn Marathon. Rides in Watopia, through New
York City's five boroughs, and eventually across the state. Swimming lessons in
the pool, lots of practice in the ocean. Hours upon hours of training. Just as
much time, if not more, spent telling everyone about said training. A few races
to get my feet wet, both figuratively and literally. Some more training.

A few weeks ago, I completed the Lake George half-distance triathlon. It was the
culmination of two years of work. The race itself was fantastic. The weather was
perfect, the water tasted as if straight out of the bottle, the bike ride
actually felt like a ride, and the run... okay, the run was tough, but good
nonetheless. I smashed my goals of having fun, not getting injured, finishing,
and going sub 6:30:00, in that order. I greeted the finish line with tears of
triumph.

And gratitude.

For my wife who helped me take those first few steps - the only person I'd want
to take them with. For her parents who strolled with me on the boardwalk. For
the people who called to ask how I was. For the friends who jogged with me, ran
with me. For the little ones who cheered me on. For my bike tour companion. For
my swim partner. For every person who sent good vibes my way during the race:
"Nice mustache." "Nice bike rack." For parents who always told me I could do
anything I put my mind to. For the undeserved and unconditional love of my dog.
For everyone who helped me at any step along the way - and for my wife (again)
who helped me at *every* step along the way, including many a much-needed "power
up" kiss.

The journey doesn't end here. I've only earned the right to start training for a
full-distance race, which will inevitably be the hardest thing I've ever done.
But for now, I'm wholly content with how far I've come and, more importantly,
the ones that I'm with. You people are my world.
