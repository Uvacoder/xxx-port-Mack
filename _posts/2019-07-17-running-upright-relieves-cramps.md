A few friends and I are running the second half of the San Francisco Marathon on
Saturday, July 27th. I've been pretty good about following a ten week training
schedule - haven't missed a day so far. (This is in stark contrast with half
marathon I ran two years ago, for which I was woefully unprepared.)

Something I've noticed while training: midway through long runs, I tend to cramp
up in my abdomen area - a sharp stabbing pain right underneath my rib cage.
Apparently it's called a "side stitch"
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_stitch)). In any case, it's no
fun, so I've put some effort into figuring out how to mitigate/prevent.

The obvious remedy is simply to slow down. To catch my breath. But to do so is
to admit defeat, and I *will not* let the cramp win. Another pretty common piece
of advice is to drink more water. Unfortunately, I don't have much anecdotal
evidence for this one, as my hydration has been solid over the past couple of
weeks (shout out to my new huge water bottle).

In any case, here's what's worked for me:
- Breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth
    -  It's probably less about the nose/mouth thing and more about controlling
       my breathing. (And in fact, a quick Google search reveals that breathing
       through the nose is inefficient and dumb. It's all about controlling your
       breathing.)
- Running upright
    - It's probably less about my posture and more about *pulling back* a bit,
      but not enough to feel like I'm cheating.  (Again, a quick Google search
      reveals that *leaning forward* is the remedy, not standing upright. I'm
      just a weirdo.)
- Pinching oneself
    - According to something someone once said, the best way to stop feeling
      intense pain in one area of your body is to *start* feeling intense pain
      *elsewhere* on your body. Don't believe me? Try it next time you have a
      cramp - 10/10 relief guaranteed. 
- Anthropomorphizing the cramp
    - The cramp is not me. The cramp is the devil. I grit my teeth and silently
      curse at the cramp. I will *not* be defeated - I've spent too much time
      training to let it get the best of me.

Looking forward to next Saturday!
