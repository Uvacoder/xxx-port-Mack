title: Travis CI Open Source Plan
---

Travis CI recently announced a [new pricing
model](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing). Most
prominently, open-source builds are no longer free. Instead, they're giving
current open-source maintainers 10,000 credits to start - about 1,000 minutes of
Linux build time - and selling additional credits at a rate of 25,000 credits
for $15.

As expected,
[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24964601)
[was](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25003387)
[upset](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25155203), primarily because Travis
CI explicitly stated that open-source builds would be free forever. Nothing
stings quite like the ol' bait-and-switch.

Not all hope was lost, however. Buried in the announcement:

> We will be offering an allotment of OSS minutes that will be reviewed and
allocated on a case by case basis. Should you want to apply for these credits
please open a request with Travis CI support stating that youâ€™d like to be
considered for the OSS allotment. 

Mostly just to exhaust my options, I opened a request:

> Hi! I maintain a public repository on GitHub called
> [spotify-playlist-archive](https://github.com/mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive).
> As the name suggests, it's a community-curated archive of public Spotify
> playlists. May I sign up for an Travis CI open source plan, so that the
> project continues to run smoothly? Thanks, Mack

About a week later, I got a reply:

> Hello Mack, Thanks for your patience while we worked on your request. We are
> awaiting further approval for your account and will promptly apply credits as
> directed to your account. In the meantime, however, we have added 50,000
> credits to your account to enable you continue using the service. I hope this
> helps. Thanks and we will follow up soon.

To their credit, I actually did get the 50,000 credits - about 83 hours and 20
minutes of build time - which is enough to last me *years* since I only use a
minute of build time per day. Still, it's been almost two weeks since that
reply, and I have a feeling they're not actually going to follow up,
especially given that
[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25338983) says they're no
longer giving credits to open-source projects. Only time will tell...
