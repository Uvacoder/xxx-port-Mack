#### Discussion

Back in April, David and I raced the Alpha Win Napa Valley 70.3. The race kicked
my butt: the swim was freezing cold, the bike was super hilly
([>4000ft of climbing](https://www.strava.com/routes/2984141782536596214) over 56
miles), and the run was HOT. That said, it was still a ton of fun, and I'm happy
I did it.

Some notes:

- This was David's first official triathlon! He did great.
- I popped my front tire the night before the race. Luckily, we hadn't left yet
so it was easy enough to grab a(nother) spare tube and replace it. I'm really
happy it didn't happen on the course!
- The water was freezing cold, so the organizers cut the swim in half, from 1.2M
to 0.6M. It was still really hard. I definitely didn't train enough. I felt
dizzy in T1. Oof.
- The bike was very hilly. 10 climbs in total. I absolutely torched my legs.
   - I forgot to take my bike rack off - definitely didn't help
- My nutrition was better than during the Lake George 70.3. I drank a decent
amount and ate a croissant on the bike, all while wearing Invisalign retainers,
lol.
