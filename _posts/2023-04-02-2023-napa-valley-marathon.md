#### Discussion

A few weeks ago, I ran the 2023 Napa Valley Marathon. I was quite looking
forward to the race, for a few reasons:
1. I had run this race back in 2020 and was excited to see how much I had
improved since then.
1. I felt great going into the race. My training runs had gone better than
expected.
1. My good friend David was *also* running the race -- hooray for camaraderie!


It rained on race day, which was a bummer, but that was really the only thing
that went wrong all day. I felt great through the first few miles and decided to
shoot for sub-3:30, my goal for all of 2023. I figured, "Hey, I'm feeling good,
why not?" Running with wet socks sucked, but the pacers did a fantastic job and
carried me through the last few miles. I surely would've fallen off pace
without them.  In the end, I finished in just under 3:30 -- a huge personal
accomplishment!

The course itself was almost exactly as I remembered it, except for one thing:
the roads were a lot less "level" than I realized during 2020. My current
running shoes have a lot more height than the ones I used back then, so I was
much more aware of the tilting, banking roads this time around. Other than that,
it felt the same. The last long stretch in particular was almost identical to
how I remembered it; it felt like it went on *forever*.

Anyway, it was a good race, and I'm stoked I achieved my goal so early in the
year. I beat my PR by more than 15 minutes, and I beat my time from 2020 by
nearly an hour. The progress is real! I probably won't do this race again, but I
definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to run hills with pretty views of
wineries.
