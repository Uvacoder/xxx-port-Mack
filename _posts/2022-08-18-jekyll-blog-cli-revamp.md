title: Jekyll Blog CLI Revamp
tags: [software]
---


A while back, I whipped up a [CLI]({% post_url 2019-11-19-jekyll-blog-cli %})
for making it easier to edit blog posts. Recently, that CLI broke -
`argcomplete` stopped working - so I took the opportunity to reimplement the CLI
in Bash:
[`blog.sh`](https://github.com/mackorone/dotfiles/blob/main/bashrc/blog.sh).

I thought I had more to say but I guess that's it.
