title: "Avoiding Frontier Airlines' Carrier Interface Charge"
tags: [travel, money]
---

I recently booked a flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Orlando (MCO). Normally,
my wife and I fly the bigger carriers--Delta, JetBlue, United, Alaska--but this
was a solo trip, so I had the "luxury" of choosing a cheaper option. Frontier
Airlines had the least expensive flights by a few hundred dollars but most of the
routes were awful, such as a 20-hour layover in Denver. After a bit a searching,
I found a route that wasn't totally insane and pulled the trigger.

During checkout, I was prompted to choose a seat and pay for carry-on baggage. I
declined both, deciding in the moment that I would challenge myself to see just
how little I could pay. After declining a few more add-ons, I entered my credit
card information and received a confirmation email with the following cost
breakdown:

As you may have guessed, the "Carrier Interface Charge" jumped out at me; I had
no idea what it was, it was apparently non-refundable, and I paid it four
times! Google and Reddit told me that the charge was for using the website to
book the flights (really?), and that I could avoid the fee by booking the
flights at the airport.

As luck would have it, I had an unrelated flight out of SFO the following
morning.

*Challenge accepted.*

I arrived at the airport about 30 minutes earlier than usual and walked straight
to the Frontier Airlines counter (the queue was empty, thankfully). I explained
that I wanted to purchase a flight in-person to avoid the "Carrier Interface
Charge," but the agent had no idea what I was talking about. "That's okay," I
said, "Let's just see how much it would cost to book the same flights using
your system."

Lo and behold, the total was $92 less than when I booked the tickets
online, which is exactly how much I paid in carrier interface charges. I
promptly canceled my previous booking and gave the agent my ID and credit card
to complete the new booking, again declining add-ons like seat selection. A few
moments later, I received the following confirmation email:

Success!

A few notes:

- The agent actually wrote down the words "Carrier Interface Charge" and beside
them, "Website fee." She seemed stunned that such a fee existed. *You and me
both.*

- In my humble opinion, booking via the website is easier and cheaper for both
parties, and charging a fee is basically just extortion. "What are you going to
do, drive to the airport just to book flights?" *Yes, yes I am.*

- It's super shady--fraudulent?--that Frontier Airlines charged the fee four
times. If you want to charge me a fee for the convenience of booking a trip on
your website, then it should be a single fee, not per leg of the trip (one
layover in each direction).

- Despite the carrier interface charge being non-refundable, it was refunded
because I canceled the old booking within 24 hours. To Frontier's credit, their
cancellation page told me exactly how much money I would be refunded so I knew
ahead of time if the swap would save me money.

- Minor correction to the story above: I actually booked new flights before
canceling the old ones. And I'm kind of surprised I was able to double-book
myself for the same flights. Shouldn't there be a sanity check somewhere?

- Despite declining seat selection at the counter, the agent still assigned me
a seat. In fact, she assigned me the same window seat on all four flights.
Maybe something in their system requires a seat selection, even if the customer
declines one?

- It goes without saying, but I will probably never book Frontier Airlines
tickets via their website again. Depending on how the flights go, I may never
book in person, either.
