#### Discussion

Today was the 113th Annual Dipsea Race! I ran it for the first time, having
succeeded in the "first come, first serve" method of entry thanks to USPS
priority mail.

The race was a ton of fun: lots of elevation, challenging trails, and beautiful
scenery. The "head start" mechanic made it completely unique and interesting--
I've never run alongside seven-year-olds before--and the lore surrounding the race
made it quite charming. It was hard to go long without hearing someone talk about
the famed "Cardiac" section of the race.

I fared well, managing to finish without any major falls or stoppages. I decided
not to take any shortcuts, for fear of twisting an ankle, and I'm happy with
that choice. I cramped around mile seven, but thankfully it didn't last too
long. I finished in 770th place overall, just missing my goal of top 750, but
I'm still really proud of how I did.

In lieu of a bunch of pictures, I made a video containing the footage I captured
during the race. Click on the picture below to watch!
