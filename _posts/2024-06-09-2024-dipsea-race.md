#### Discussion

Today, I ran the 113th Annual Dipsea Race in Mill Valley, California, the
oldest trail race in America. The race is unique for a bunch of reasons:

- Getting in is difficult. I was lucky enough to snag a spot via the
"first-come, first-served" method of entry thanks to USPS Priority Mail.
- There's an incredible variety of runners who participate: kids as young as
seven, adults older than seventy, and everyone in between. Lots of past race
winners, too.
- There's a "head start" mechanic based on gender and age, which makes it
possible for any age group to win the race. You're either chasing or being
chased the entire time.
- Some parts of the course—especially the stairs—were bottlenecks. Navigating
these bottlenecks while remaining respectful of the other runners is part of the
challenge.
- The course is point-to-point, and shortcuts are fair game. In fact, because
the race is so old, there's a wealth of lore surrounding the course and which
routes are fastest.

The race was challenging, chaotic, charming, and scenic. I fared well, managing
to finish without any major falls or stoppages. I decided not to take any
shortcuts, to avoid twisting an ankle, and I'm happy with that choice. I
got a side stitch around mile seven, but thankfully it didn't last too long.
I finished in 770th place overall, just shy of my goal of finishing in the top
750, but I'm still really proud of how I did.

In lieu of a bunch of pictures, I made a video containing the footage I captured
during the race. Click on the picture below to watch!
