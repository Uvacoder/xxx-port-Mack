First post on the new website!

I've been meaning to start a blog for a while now. It's something I want to have
done, and now seems as good a time as any to get started. I'm not convinced I'll
actually enjoy blogging, but I'm hopeful it'll worthwhile regardless. If nothing
else, it'll give me an opportunity to develop my "voice", something I've always
envied in others (e.g., <http://rachelbythebay.com/>).

Besides, it's only a one letter difference from vlogging, how hard could it be?
