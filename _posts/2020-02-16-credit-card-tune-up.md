About a month ago, a few friends and I spent some time chatting about which
credit cards are best, given certain spending habits. We made a spreadsheet 
to convince ourselves that, even with the recent bump to the Chase Sapphire
Reserve annual fee, from $450 to $550, the card is still worth it.

Since then, I've been daydreaming about a bigger and better spreadsheet, with
more credit cards and spending categories. Turns out, it already exists, and
it's called [creditcardtuneup.com](http://www.creditcardtuneup.com/). I've only
played around with it for a few minutes, but I already really like some of its
features:

- Results sorted by best value
- Inline details about each card
- Tooltips that explain the numbers
- The ability to filter out certain cards
- A timestamp in the header with the last update time
- An "Apply Now" button, which I assume is their business model

I like when my something on my to-do list is already done.
