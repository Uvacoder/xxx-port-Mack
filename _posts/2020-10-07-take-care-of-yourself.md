My manager gave me some feedback last week that didn’t resonate until I watched
the Bills game on Sunday. He said something to the effect of "Take care of
yourself," which I interpreted as him being nice. Later, when I saw Josh Allen
get hurt trying to be the hero, I got frustrated because I’d much rather he play
the next twelve games than make a single good play. Then I realized that I am
Josh Allen and my manager is me.
