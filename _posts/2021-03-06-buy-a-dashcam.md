Hot take: every vehicle on the road should have a dashcam. They should come
pre-installed in every car. It boggles my mind that they don't.

Sure, I understand the security/privacy concerns. We don't want vehicle
manufacturers spying on us. We don't want *other cars* spying on us,
crowdsourcing our live locations. Fair enough, don't connect them to the
internet. Keep everything local.

Sell them at dealerships alongside the heating steering wheels, rubber mats,
roof racks, etc. What new car buyer wouldn't want the added peace of mind -
*professionally installed* - for a negligible cost? Heck, dealerships could even
partner with insurance companies; presumably they be happy to pay for each sale
to a covered individual. 


Anyways, if you don't already have a dashcam, get one. A good one costs less
than $50, is easy to install (it's a suction cup with a wire), and is worth its
weight in gold the instant you need to prove you're not at fault for something.
Video evidence wins disputes.
