#### Discussion

I recently completed my first "official" triathlon! It was a ton of fun: the
preparation, the anticipation, the race itself, the post-race celebration -
everything. It's safe to say I'm hooked.

I had a few goals for the race:

- Finish
- Don't get injured
- Have fun

All of which I achieved, thankfully.

Going into the race, I was most nervous about the swim. It was my first time
racing in the open water and I just knew I'd be too excited to pace myself. Sure
enough, I went out a bit too fast and the swim was longer than expected, so I
was breathing pretty hard by the end of it. I was light-headed during T1,
especially while taking off my wetsuit, but was able to catch my breath and
balance before taking off on the bike. The ride was cool and flat, as was the
run, and it was over before I knew it.

Lessons learned:
- Swimming with other people is chaotic - stay calm
- It's hard to swim staight - peek up every few strokes
- Expect to feel dizzy after the swim - go slow during T1
- Fitness watch goes on top of wetsuit, comes off during T1
- The wetsuit is easier to take off than anticipated - just pull
- Make sure to hit the "transition" button, not the "pause" button, next time
- Using the aero bars takes some adjustment - practice to avoid sore back
